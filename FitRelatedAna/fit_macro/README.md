macro to fit the wiggle plot

1. fitWiggle.C 
   
  using fit function to fit the data

2. obtain_parameter.C

  obtain the fit parameters in diff fit range and diff energy threshold, and store them in a tree
  each leaf is in array structure, leaf[i] correspond the i_th energy threshold

  leaf[0]-1.86GeV
  leaf[1]-1.6 GeV
  leaf[2]-1.7 GeV
  leaf[3]-1.8 GeV
  leaf[4]-1.9 GeV
  leaf[5]-2.0 GeV
  leaf[6]-2.1 GeV
  leaf[7]-2.2 GeV
